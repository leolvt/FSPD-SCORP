FSPD - SCORP
============

The project
-----------

This project is an implementation of a *Structural CORrelation Pattern Mining
(SCORP) algorithm*. I'm working on this project as part of my course on
distributed systems at UFMG. The goal of the project is to implement a
distributed version of the SCORP algorithm, using the *Anthill Framework*,
developed at UFMG.

Building and Dependencies
-------------------------

### Dependencies 

The serial version of the algorithm is in C++, there are no dependencies. For
the distributed version, you must have Anthill installed. You can find more
about Anthill and how to install it on its [homepage][1].

## Building

You can build the project using the CMake tool. With it you can easily configure
the location of the Anthill files and other needed configurations.
